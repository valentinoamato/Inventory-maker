A Python based program that helps you create inventories and keep track of everything.

---
> Requirements
> 
To use the program you will need the following:
* Python 3 installed
* The two files: **engine.py** and **main.py**

The two scripts have to be in the same folder

---
> Running

To run the program execute **main.py** and enter the desired operations in the terminal

A JSON file will be created in the folder with the scripts

This file will contain all the information entered by the user 

If the JSON file already exist at the time of running the program, it will not create a new one

Instead it will try to read and display the data in it
